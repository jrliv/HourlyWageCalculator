# Hourly Wage Calculator

By <a href="https://jrliv.com/about/" target="_blank">Jae Logan</a>

## Description

This is a simple WPF desktop application that I created as a side project for fun. When the application starts it generates an employee ID and allows you to enter an hourly employee's name, department, hourly rate, and number of hours worked. From there you can either click on the Calculate button or the Clear button. The Calculate button will calculate the total pay and any overtime if the employee has worked over 40 hours. It will also display the totals under the forms section. The Clear button will clear the forms and generate a new employee ID.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it so I included the executable file. If you're using Windows and you just want to run and play with it you can download and run <a href="https://github.com/jrliv/HourlyWageCalculator/blob/master/HourlyWageCalculator/bin/Debug/HourlyWageCalculator.exe" target="_blank">the executable</a>.
